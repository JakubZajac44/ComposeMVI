Design of a template mobile application for the Android platform.

The application was written according to the MVI pattern in Jetpack Compose, divided into separate modules. 
The recommended division into layers was maintained: Model - Domain - UI for each module separately.

Technologies used:
Compose - application design
Hilt - dependency injection
Coil - multimedia support
Retrofit - communication with API
Jectpack Navigation - navigation based on deeplinks
Room - local database support
Paging 3 - paging the list
